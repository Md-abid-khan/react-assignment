      "question": "What is `useState` and how does it work in React?",
      "answer": "In React, `useState` is a Hook that adds state to functional components. You declare a state variable and a function to update it. Example:\n\n```jsx\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n```\n`count` stores the value and `setCount` updates it. When state updates, the component re-renders. The initial value passed to `useState` is used only on the first render.",

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of `useEffect` in React?",
      "answer": "`useEffect` manages side effects in React components. Side effects include data fetching, event listeners, timers, and manual DOM manipulation. It runs after every render unless you provide a dependency array.\n\n```jsx\nuseEffect(() => {\n  // effect\n  return () => {\n    // cleanup\n  };\n}, [dependencies]);\n```\nIt also handles cleanup logic, like removing event listeners or clearing intervals.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is a custom hook in React and when should you use one?",
      "answer": "A custom hook is a function that starts with `use` and allows you to reuse stateful logic across components. It can use other hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.\n\nYou should use a custom hook when multiple components share the same logic, such as fetching data, forms, timers, or reusable UI behavior.\n\nExample:\n```js\nfunction useCounter() {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);\n  return { value, increment: () => setValue(value + 1) };\n}\n```",

    },
    {
      "question": "Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components? Which one is better?",
      "answer": "Controlled components store their input values in React state.\n\n```jsx\n<input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />\n```\nReact controls the input.\n\nUncontrolled components store their value in the DOM and use `ref` to access it:\n\n```jsx\n<input ref={inputRef} />\n```\nControlled is better when you need validation, instant updates, or predictable state. Uncontrolled is simpler and useful for basic forms.",
      "date": "2024-07-29"
    },
    {
      "question": "Tell us something about `useFormStatus()`",
      "answer": "`useFormStatus()` is a React hook that provides the status of a form submission. It returns values like `pending`, `data`, `method`, and `action`. It must be used inside a form.\n\nExample:\n```jsx\nconst { pending } = useFormStatus();\n<button disabled={pending}>{pending ? 'Submitting…' : 'Submit'}</button>\n```\nIt is useful for disabling buttons, showing loaders, and improving form UX without managing manual loading states.",
